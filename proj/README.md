## LDTS_T14G05 - THIN ICE

THIN ICE is a game where the player must control a Black Puffle that is on fire through a maze of ice, melting as many ice squares as possible along the way.
Reach the red square in each maze to advance to the next level, but careful, if you find yourself with no other ice square to move to, you will drown!
